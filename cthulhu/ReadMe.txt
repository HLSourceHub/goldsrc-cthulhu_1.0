Description	: a new Single Player Episode for HL
Credits/Thanks	: lots of people - see CREDITS.TXT

-------Stuff---------------------------------------------------------

STORY: You are Ranulf Satfford, occult investigator in 1928 Arkham, USA.


REQUIREMENTS: A PC that runs Half-Life smooth
              Half-Life patch 1.1.1.0 or later

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. this mod will only run in 640 x 480 resolution or higher.
2. It is STRONGLY recommended that you play the "Occult Training" (aka Hazard Course) before playing this mod.
3. This mod uses the Half-Life CD music, so I recommend you have the CD in your CD-drive.
4. If I have missed anyone out of CREDITS.TXT (I forgot where I got some resources from), please let me know and I will credit you properly.

WALKTHROUGH: see WALKTHROUGH.TXT.

RUNNING CTHULHU: You have two options...
1. Create the following shortcut: C:\Sierra\Half-Life\hl.exe -console -game cthulhu
2. Start Half-Life, click on "Custom Game", then select "Cthulhu"

KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:
1. Some levels have quite high r-speeds (sorry).
2. In a couple of places it is possible to get stuck during level transitions, but you have to try quite hard to do this!
3. There is a crash in a couple of levels while using Direct3D. It has something to do with rain interacting with the sky (I'm looking into it). Try switching to OpenGL or Software video mode for these levels.
