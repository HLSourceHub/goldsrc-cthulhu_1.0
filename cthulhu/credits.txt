I have used a lot of resources from the internet in this mod.
I have tried to credit everyone, but some resources did not include a ReadMe.txt file and I simply cannot remember where they came from. So, to those people let me apologise.
If you see your prefab/texture/whatever in this mod and you are not credited, please let me know and I will credit you!
